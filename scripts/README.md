# Scripts

This folder contains all the computational scripts used in the project for data processing, analysis, and metabolic simulations. The scripts are organized into two main subfolders:

## Folder Structure
- `R/`: Contains R scripts for data preprocessing, statistical analyses, and visualization.
- `FBA/`: Contains scripts related to Flux Balance Analysis (FBA) simulations, including diet-specific metabolic modeling and SCFA predictions.

## R/
The `R` folder includes scripts for:
- Processing microbial abundance data
- Generating summary statistics
- Creating figures for taxonomic and functional profiling
- Merging, filtering, and normalizing datasets
- Any other R-based analysis used in the study

##FBA/ 
Contains scripts related to Flux Balance Analysis (FBA) simulations, including diet-specific metabolic modeling and SCFA predictions.
